      <p class="card-text"> I was born is Los Angeles California in 1982, where i currently reside.
             I'm of Cuban descent, my parents migrated here in 1980 from La Habana Cuba. My mother left 
             when i was a baby and my father past away when i was a teenager. Life has definately given me 
             some difficult barriers to overcome. Fortunately for me i was able to find balance...</p>
      <p>I love art! I'm able to draw with ball point pens. I can draw anything from Portraits to
               cars and anything inbetween, i am also a certified tattoo Artist. I make car decals, custom 
               shirts, i'm very hands on. I build my own shelves, i install my own car dvr systems, and i 
               seldomly buy something pre-built. The most important detail that you can know about me is that
               i like to do things that are challenging.</p>
